# HTMLoad
ðŸ”¥ Hot reloading for static sites ðŸ”¥

## Introduction

HTMLoad is a hot reloader for static sites, designed to simplify the development and preview process for web developers and designers. With HTMLoad, you can instantly see changes to your static files without manually refreshing your browser. Leveraging the native file uploader, HTMLoad tracks changes from the original file and reflects them in real-time.

## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/HTMLoad.git

 2.  Place ```htmload.html``` in the same directory as the file(s) you wish to edit:
Ensure that the reload.html file from this repository is in the same directory as the file(s) you wish to hot-reload.

3. Open ```htmload.html``` in your browser:
Simply double-click on reload.html or drag it into your browser window.

4. Use the native file uploader to select the file you wish to hot-reload:
Once you've uploaded your desired file, any changes made to that file will be reflected in real-time in your browser.

## Roadmap
Here are some features we're looking to add to HTMLoad in the future:

- [ ] Multi-file uploading: Allow users to upload and track changes for multiple files simultaneously.
- [ ] Folder/Directory Upload: Enable users to upload an entire directory and track changes to any file within.
- [ ] Live Preview for CSS/JS: Apart from HTML, provide a live preview for CSS and JavaScript files.
- [ ] Updated UI: Fix the appearance and behavior of the hot-reloading interface.
- [ ] Integration with popular frameworks: Offer compatibility and integration options with popular static site generators and frameworks.
